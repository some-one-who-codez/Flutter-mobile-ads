A new Flutter project showing an example use case of the new flutter mobile ads. (Except native ads). There is a video [tutorial](https://youtu.be/KyCPhxNTDhU) explaining this app.

## What this app does
This app loads the first page which has many different buttons to load different ad types. It also has a banner ad which is displayed on both pages.

## Important!
The app has not been set up for IOS even though it implements platform specific ad unit ids. For this to work successfully on IOS the `Info.plist` file must be changed to include the `GADApplicationIdentifier` key and the `SKAdNetworkItems` key. See the [documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mobile_ads) for more info.
